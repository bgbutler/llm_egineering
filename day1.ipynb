    "Our goal is to code a new kind of Web Browser. Give it a URL, and it will respond with a summary. The Reader's Digest of the internet!!\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting, you should have completed the setup for [PC](../SETUP-PC.md) or [Mac](../SETUP-mac.md) and you hopefully launched this jupyter lab from within the project root directory, with your environment activated.\n",

    "Welcome to the wonderful world of Data Science experimentation! Once you've used Jupyter Lab, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it. Simply click in each \"cell\" with code in it, such as the cell immediately below this text, and hit Shift+Return to execute that cell. As you wish, you can add a cell with the + button in the toolbar, and print values of variables, or try out variations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I've written a notebook called [Guide to Jupyter](Guide%20to%20Jupyter.ipynb) to help you get more familiar with Jupyter Labs, including adding Markdown comments, using `!` to run shell commands, and `tqdm` to show progress.\n",

Rather, I execute Jupyter Labs, like this, and give you an intuition for what's going on. My suggestion is that you carefully execute this yourself, <b>after</b> watching the lecture. Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations. If you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations. Not only is this essential practice, but it demonstrates your skills to others, including perhaps future clients or employers...</span>\n",

We'll do fun things like have LLMs tell jokes and argue with each other. But fundamentally, my goal is to teach skills you can apply in business. I'll explain business implications as we go, and it's worth keeping this in mind: as you build experience with models and techniques, think of ways you could put this into action at work today.

Adding it to your diet can help you treat many chronic diseases. Its potential benefits include lowering your cholesterol, preventing cancer, and acting as a blood thinner. Perhaps one of the most underrated abilities of this pungent-smelling herb is its ability to lower blood pressure. Here is a detailed breakdown of what you should know about using garlic to treat\\nhypertension\\n.\\nHow does garlic treat your high blood pressure?\\nRecent research¬π\\xa0has shown that garlic can be a suitable remedy for lowering high blood pressure with fewer side effects than most prescription drugs. So, what does garlic have that treats high blood pressure?\\nAllicin. This is the main active compound in garlic, considered the contributing factor in garlic's ability to lower blood pressure. According to recent research, allicin can prevent angiotensin production, a hormone\\xa0responsible for raising blood pressure by contracting the blood vessels.\\nBy inhibiting angiotensin, allicin allows your blood to flow freely and easily, reducing your blood pressure. Finally, many experts believe that garlic's antioxidant and anti-inflammatory ability help\\nprevent and reduce high blood pressure\\n.\\nWhat does research say about garlic to treat high blood pressure?\\nMany research studies have been conducted to determine the efficacy of garlic in reducing high blood pressure. In a report published by\\xa0BMC Cardiovascular Disorders¬≤\\xa0(2008), a review of 11 previously published\\nclinical trials\\nshowed that garlic was a better remedy for reducing blood pressure for people with hypertension compared to alternatives.\\nBased on this research, ten of the 11 published clinical reports claimed that garlic lowers blood pressure among patients with high systolic blood pressure. However, it wasn't associated with blood pressure decrease among patients with low systolic blood pressure.\\nIn another\\xa0clinical trial published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition¬≥,\\xa0participants who took high doses of garlic showed significant blood pressure reduction.\\nIn this clinical trial, the 79 participants were given a garlic extract or dosage of 240mg of garlic, 480, or 960 for 12 weeks. Among these people, those that took 480 or 960mg of garlic extract showed a significant\\nlowering of the systolic blood pressure\\nreading. Those that took 240mg didn't experience any decrease in their systolic blood pressure.\\nFrom the above two pieces of research, it's reasonable to conclude that garlic can be a suitable remedy for treating your blood pressure. So, the question arises, how much garlic is enough to treat your high blood pressure? Let's see.\\nHow much garlic should you use to treat high blood pressure?\\nThe amount of garlic that can treat your high blood pressure narrows down to specific doses from a report based on several clinical trials¬π. So far, this report has provided the following garlic doses for treating hypertension:\\n188mg of garlic powder mixed with egg-yolk taken daily for twelve weeks\\n400mg of raw garlic taken daily for six months\\n240-2,400mg of aged garlic extract a day for two to twenty-three weeks\\n600 ‚Äì 2,400mg of garlic powder daily for eight to twenty-four weeks\\n12.3mg of garlic oil daily for sixteen weeks\\nEven though the above dosage and forms can significantly lower blood pressure, most studies suggest that using\\xa0aged garlic extract\\xa0can achieve the most benefits. Apart from that, taking high doses between 400mg to 2,4000mg proves to be more effective than lower doses.\\nWhat is the best form of garlic to treat high blood pressure?\\nYou can use different forms of garlic to treat your high blood pressure. These forms are as follows:\\nEat it raw\\nEating raw garlic is one of the best ways you can use garlic to lower your blood pressure. Raw garlic activates alliinase, an enzyme that converts alliin into allicin. You should consume raw garlic within an hour or two of a meal to activate alliinase and achieve maximum benefits.\\nGarlic powder\\nUsing garlic powder can also significantly lower your blood pressure, with 600-900mg of it leading to a 9-12% reduction of your high blood pressure‚Å¥. This garlic powder contains 3.6mg to 5.4mg of allicin, hence its excellent results.\\nSalads\\nGarlic is also a good option for making your salad healthier, in addition to adding flavor. You can add minced or grated garlic to your daily salad to reduce your high blood pressure.\\nGarlic milk\\nYou can also use garlic milk to reduce your high blood pressure and achieve an overall benefit on your health. All you have to do is mix ten to twelve minced garlic cloves to warm milk. It will also help to add a tablespoon of honey into the drink to achieve better results.\\nWhat are the best garlic supplements for treating high blood pressure?\\nThere are several garlic supplements available on the market. Here are the top seven supplements you can consider:\\nBRI Nutrition Odorless Garlic\\nThis is arguably the best-known garlic supplement on the market. Compared with other supplements, this product is suitable for vegans and is sold in capsules, guaranteeing immediate results and being easy to swallow.
